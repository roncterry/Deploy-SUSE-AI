# K8s distro version channel to deploy from
#
# This is the channel containing the version of K8s (RKE2/K3S) to deploy.
#
# If you need a specific version you must supply the version tag.
#   Example: v1.30
# 
# If a spcific version tag is not specified then you must supply one of 
# the following version tags: stable, latest, testing
#   Example: stable
#
# Default: stable

# Used as the name of the cluster when configuring name resolution or also

# Value Used for the Cluster Token

# DNS Domain Name
#
# DNS domain name of the cluster nodes and the cluster

#
export DOMAIN_NAME=example.com


# Disable Built-in RKE services
#
# Space-delimited list
#
# If you want to disable any of the built-in RKE2 services, add them to this
# variable.
#
# For example if you want to install an external ingress controller rather than
# have RKE2 install the built-in rke2-ingress-nginx controller add 
# 'rke2-ingress-nginx' to the variable. 
#
# (Note: This is usefull if you want to install kube-vip to configure a cluster 
#  virtual IP which requires configuration of ingress-nginx separatly instead 
#  of using the built-in ingress-nginx.)

#
# Options: true|false

# Default: false
#
# Note: If INSTALL_EXTERNAL_INGRESS_CONTROLLER=true then

#       to ensure the built-in ingress controller is not enabled.
#
#       This must be set to 'true' if INSTALL_KUBEVIP=true
#

# Namespace to Install the External Ingress Controller Into
#
# Default: kube-system
#
# The namespace where the built-in ingress controller is installed is 
# kube-system. Installing into that namespace avoids certificate issues.
#
export EXTERNAL_INGRESS_CONTROLLER_NAMESPACE=kube-system


# How to Deploy the External Ingress Controller
#
# Options: Deployment|DaemonSet
#
# Default: Deployment
#
# When set to DaemonSet the number of replicas does not need to be set becase
# a replica will be created on each node in the cluster.
#
export EXTERNAL_INGRESS_CONTROLLER_KIND=DaemonSet


# Number of External Ingress Controller Repicas
#
# Default: 1

# Install kube-vip to Configure a Cluster Virtual IP
#
# Options: true|false
#
# Default: false
#
# Note: If INSTALL_KUBEVIP=true then you must also set:
#       INSTALL_EXTERNAL_INGRESS_CONTROLLER=true
#       and
#       DISABLE_BUILTIN_SERVICE_LIST must include 'rke2-ingress-nginx'
#
#       You must also set a virtual IP in RKE2_CLUSTER_VIP
# 
export INSTALL_KUBEVIP=false


# Virtual IP for the RKE2 cluster
#
#  Note: If a virtual IP is set here then you must also set:

# Number of Replicas of Longhorn Service Pods
#
# This typically is set to the number of cluster nodes in the Longhorn cluster.
# For example, if you have a single node cluster this should be set to: 1
#
# This is used for the following Helm chart values:
#   defaultSettings:defaultReplicaCount
#
# Default: 3
#
export LH_DEFAULT_REPLICA_COUNT=1


# The Number of Volume Replicas in the Default Storage Class
#
# When the defualt storage class is created (default name: longhorn) when
# Longhorn is deployed, this is the default number of volume replicas that
# will be defined in that storage class.
#
# This is typically set to the number of cluster nodes if less than 3.
# For example, if you have a single node cluster this should be set to: 1
#
# This is used for the following Helm chart values:
#   persistence:defaultClassReplicaCount
#
# Default: 3
#
export LH_DEFAULT_CLASS_REPLICA_COUNT=1


# The Number of CSI Service Pods
#
# This typically is set to the number of cluster nodes in the Longhorn cluster.
# For example, if you have a single node cluster this should be set to: 1
#
# This is used for the following Helm chart values:
#    csi:attacherReplicaCount
#    csi:provisionerReplicaCount
#    csi:resizerReplicaCount
#    csi:snapshotterReplicaCount
#
# Default: 3
#
export LH_CSI_REPLICA_COUNT=1


# The Percentage of the Default Disk that is Not to Be Allocated
#
# This defines the percentage of the default disk that will not be allocated
# for use as Longhorn storage.
#
# For example, if you have a 1TB disk and if your root volume (/) is 850GB and 
# the percentage is set to 30, only roughly 550GB will be used for Longhorn 
# storage leaving roughly 250GB for use by other things (OS, etc.).
#
# If the first disk is the same disk that your OS is installed on you might 
# want to watch this. However if that disk in 1TB, 30 is probably a little too 
# much to reserve. You might consider setting this to a lower value like 20 or 
# even 15.
#
# This is used for the following Helm chart values:
#   defaultSettings:storageReservedPercentageForDefaultDisk
#
# Default: 30
